# TimeCraft
TimeCraft is a program that allows you to synchronize your Todo lists from Notion with your Google Calendar. With TimeCraft, you can schedule your tasks efficiently to optimize your daily agenda. It employs a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal scheduling of your tasks within your calendar.

## Scheduling Algorithm
The scheduling algorithm ensures that your tasks are placed in your calendar without conflicting with existing appointments. If there are limited scheduling options available, the algorithm evaluates the score of each option and selects the best one. For scenarios with more options, it employs a genetic algorithm to find the optimal solution.

Upon reaching the scheduled end time for a task, TimeCraft automatically updates the todo appointment. Additionally, when you mark a task as completed within the app, TimeCraft automatically updates your schedule.

## Settings
As of *Version 0.3*, there are no available settings.
