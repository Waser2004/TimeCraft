# TimeCraft
TimeCraft is an innovative tool designed to synchronize your Todo lists from Notion with your Google Calendar, enabling you to manage your tasks more effectively. By utilizing a genetic algorithm, TimeCraft optimizes the scheduling of your tasks to help you make the most of your daily agenda.
## Key Features
- **Todo and Calendar Synchronization:** Seamlessly integrate your Notion Todo lists with Google Calendar.
- **Intelligent Scheduling:** Utilize a genetic algorithm to find the best times for your tasks, ensuring no conflicts with existing appointments.
- **Interactive Rescheduling:** Hover over tasks in your calendar to move them up or down in priority, locking specific tasks to prevent automatic changes.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Automatically update your calendar when tasks are marked as completed or when scheduled times are reached.

## Scheduling Algorithm

The algorithm behind TimeCraft intelligently places your tasks in your calendar without overlapping with other appointments. It evaluates all available scheduling options:

- **With only a few Options:** The algorithm scores each option and selects the highest-scoring one.
- **With a lot of Options:** A genetic algorithm is employed to find the optimal schedule.

If you disagree with the suggested schedule, you can easily adjust it by hovering over the task in your calendar. This action allows you to reorder tasks or lock specific ones, giving you control over your schedule.

## Settings
Currently, in Version 0.5, there are no configurable settings available. Future versions will include customizable options to enhance your scheduling experience.
